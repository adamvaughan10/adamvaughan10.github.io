  <h3>Project Snapshot</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Project:</strong> Phone Stabilizing Gimbal</li>
    <li><strong>Role:</strong> Mechanical Design Engineer (team of two)</li>
    <li><strong>Tools:</strong> SolidWorks</li>
    <li><strong>Status:</strong> Completed design, manufacturing-ready</li>
    <li><strong>Focus:</strong> Mechanical design and DFM (electronics and software considered, not designed)</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="section-card">
  <h3>Engineering Problem</h3>
  <p>The objective was to conceive and fully design a consumer-ready phone stabilizing gimbal, taking the product from concept through a complete, manufacturable mechanical design.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Ergonomics:</strong> Handheld videography comfort and stability</li>
    <li><strong>Motion quality:</strong> Mechanical stability and smooth motion</li>
    <li><strong>Manufacturability:</strong> Components designed for standard processes</li>
    <li><strong>Packaging:</strong> Internal space for battery placement and wire routing</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Electronics and software were treated as system-level constraints, not fully developed subsystems.</p>
</section>

<section class="section-card">
  <h3>Design Approach</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Concept exploration:</strong> Evaluated existing products and iterated multiple design directions.</li>
    <li><strong>Architecture choice:</strong> Two-handed stabilizer for stability, ergonomics, and future control surfaces.</li>
    <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Form factor and mechanical layout were driven by the two-handed architecture decision.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Mechanical Design &amp; CAD</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Handle assembly:</strong> Ergonomics, rigidity, and internal routing.</li>
    <li><strong>Gimbal assembly:</strong> Isolates and supports phone mount.</li>
    <li><strong>Phone mount assembly:</strong> Most complex component; accommodates a range of phone sizes.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A full parametric CAD model was developed in SolidWorks with attention to assembly interfaces and manufacturability.</p>

  <h3>Manufacturing &amp; Drawings</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Manufacturing considerations integrated throughout the design process.</li>
    <li>Detailed engineering drawings created for all machined components.</li>
    <li>GD&amp;T applied to control critical fits, alignment, and functional interfaces.</li>
    <li>Part geometry compatible with standard machining processes.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Final deliverables support direct handoff to manufacturing.</p>
