      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I love learning and coming to more in depth understanding of everything around me, and even more I love to apply that learning to projects, and build things that I find cool. </p>
      <p>Growing up in the San Francisco Bay Area, I was exposed to engineering from a very young age, but what really sparked this passion was seeing my high school robotics team. I thought robots were things that experts and adults made and the thought of making one thrilled me beyond belief. I immediately joined, eventually being elected the VP of Mechanical Design in my junior and senior years.</p>
      <p>Since then, it has been my dream to work on exciting engineering projects that benefit humanity. My favorite invention however, is Entrepreneurship. This idea allows driven individuals with good ideas to bring them to life and get a public referendum on whether or not they are valuable. It enables the advancement of our species and for that reason, I am incredibly excited for my next project, whatever it may be.</p>
