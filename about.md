      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a mechanical engineering student who enjoys turning equations into physical systems. My interests sit at the intersection of robotics, controls, and mechanical design, and I enjoy documenting each project from modeling through testing.</p>
      <p>Outside of coursework, I focus on building prototypes, running experiments, and refining mechanical details until the performance matches the model.</p>
